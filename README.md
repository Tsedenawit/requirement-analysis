Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting what a software system or project must do to meet the needs of its stakeholders (like users, clients, and business teams).

Requirement Elicitation

Gathering information through interviews, surveys, workshops, observation, and existing documentation.

Stakeholders include users, clients, product owners, and subject matter experts.

Requirement Analysis & Prioritization

Clarifying, organizing, and resolving conflicts among requirements.

Prioritizing requirements based on business value and feasibility.

Requirement Specification

Documenting requirements in a clear, concise, and structured format (e.g., SRS â€“ Software Requirements Specification).

May include use cases, user stories, flowcharts, and diagrams.

Requirement Validation

Ensuring the documented requirements are complete, feasible, relevant, and testable.

Getting formal approval from stakeholders.

Requirement Management

Tracking changes to requirements and maintaining consistency throughout the project lifecycle.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Early corrections cost significantly less than post-launch fixes

Reduces scope creep and unnecessary features

Helps allocate resources more effectively
